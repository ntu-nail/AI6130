# AI6130: Large Language Models

# Course Objectives

The course on Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles, architectures, and applications of state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4. This course is designed for graduate students in computer science, data science, and related fields who have a foundational knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. By taking this course, students will gain valuable skills in developing, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs, which are increasingly integral to advancements in natural language processing, automated content creation, and AI-driven decision-making. This expertise will not only enhance their academic and research capabilities but also significantly boost their employability in tech industries, research institutions, and innovative startups focused on AI and machine learning technologies.

# Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

**Our Approach**

- Analyze the underlying architectures and mechanisms of large language models.

- Implement and fine-tune large language models for specific applications.

- Evaluate the performance of large language models in various contexts.

- Design novel applications leveraging large language models to solve real-world problems.

- Critically assess the limitations and potential improvements of current large language models.

# Assessment Approach

<!-- **Weekly Workload**

- Lecture and/or tutorial and/or practical problems implemented in PyTorch.
- There will be NO office hours.
- There will be ***10%*** marks for class participation. -->

**Assignments (individually graded)**

- There will be two (2) assignments contributing to ***2 * 25% = 50%*** of the total assessment.
- Students will be graded individually on the assignments. They will be allowed to discuss with each other on the homework assignments, but they are required to submit individual write-ups and coding exercises.

**Final Project (Group work but individually graded)**

- There will be a final project contributing to the remaining 40% of the total coursework assessment.
  - ***3–6*** people per group
  - Project proposal: ***5%***, presentation: ***15%***, report: **30%***
- The project will be group work but the students will be graded individually. The final project presentation will ensure the student’s understanding of the project
